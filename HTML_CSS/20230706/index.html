    <p>Winners never quit and quitters never win. <span>- Vince Lombardi (1913~1970)</span></p>
    <p>You have to do what you love to do, not get stuck in that comfort zone of a regular job. Life is not a dress rehearsal. This is it. <span> - Lucinda Bassett (1956~)</span></p>
    <p>Donâ€™t hold on to anger, hurt, or pain. They steal your energy and keep you from LOVE. <span>- Leo Buscaglia (1924~1998)</span></p>
